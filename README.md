# Start project

In the project directory, you can run:

1. python -m venv env _(create new virtual environment)_

2. source env/bin/activate _(activated a virtual environment)_

3. python -m pip install -r requirements.txt _(install required lib, after youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment)_
